    <h2>The name of my favorite meal is jollof rice</h2>
    <h2>Origin of rice</h2>
    <p>It is probably a descendent of wild grass that was most likely cultivated in the foothills of the far Eastern Himalayas. Another school of thought believes that the rice plant may have originated in southern India, then spread to the north of the country and then onwards to China.</p>

    <h2>How to prepare jollof rice</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend your tomatoes, scotch bonnet, and tatashe together.
            <br>Chop your onions and keep them aside.</li>
        <li>Put your rice into a bowl and soak with hot water.
            <br>Allow this to soak for 10-15 minutes. Then, wash with warm water and keep aside, or parboil your rice and wash. This is important as you will get rid of excess starch in the rice.</li>
        <li>Heat up your oil.<br>Put your oil in a pot and allow it to heat up.</li>
        <li>Add your chopped onions and allow them to fry.
            <br>Be sure not to burn the onions in the process.</li>
        <li>Add and fry your blended ingredients and purée.
            <br>Allow them to fry until you get rid of the sour taste (about 10-15 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add your maggi, garlic, ginger, curry, thyme and salt.
            <br>Mix it all together. Be careful with your maggi as you do not want it too salty (2 maggi cubes for a cup of rice). Add your stock or water, and mix too. Taste to adjust to any seasoning.</li>
        <li>Pour your rice into the pot and mix together.
            <br>Make sure it is covered in the tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook on low medium heat.
            <br>Check your rice after at least 10 minutes, using a wooden spatula to dip into the rice. This helps with getting the sauce to get the bottom of the pot, so that it does not start burning when the rice is not cooked.</li>
        <li>Cook until soft.
            <br>Do not overcook your rice or get your rice too soggy. When rice is soft, lower the heat and allow to simmer so the water will get completely dry.</li>
    </ol>
